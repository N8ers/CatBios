This Groovy cat adoption website was built with flexbox with 70's influenced design, not to mention a feline lorem ipsum. 
This project was done in tandum with another programmer <a href="https://github.com/klcantrell" target="_blank">Kalalau Cantrell</a>. 
This project uses HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, and was the first colaborative project I had done using version control.
